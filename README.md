### work in progress...
- the idea is to have a notification that will pop up after booting up the computer, informing user about current/approaching moon phase and constellation
- so far i have finished calculation of needed values for the notification
- next steps is to build the notification itself and make it run after the computer turns on
  -  this is mostly done, first version of the notification is working. for running at startup i simply moved the script into the startup folder...
