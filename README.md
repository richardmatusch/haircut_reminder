## **Installation:**

To use this script, you need to have Python installed along with the following dependencies:
- 'win11toast'
- 'ephem'

## **Usage:**

- place the script in the startup folder (you can find it easily by pressing windows key + r and then typing "shell:startup")
- input your notification icon path into line 47 in the code (this has to be different than startup folder - otherwise the image itself will open with every start of the computer)
- i've got my free icon from here: https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/lion_616412?term=lion&page=1&position=1&origin=tag&related_id=616412
