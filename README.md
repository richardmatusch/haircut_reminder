## **Installation:**

To use this script, you need to have Python installed along with the following dependencies:
- 'win11toast'
- 'ephem'

## **Usage:**

- place the script in the startup folder (you can find it easily by pressing windows key + r and then typing "shell:startup")
- input your notification icon path into line 47 in the code (this has to be different than startup folder - otherwise the image itself will open with every start of the computer)
